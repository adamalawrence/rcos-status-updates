## Last Week's Accomplishments

Added a settings page

## This Week's Plan

Time to remove all those redundant api calls to poloniex each time the app startups up (mainly cause itâ€™s just so slow). Will start using a json database to store the timeseries data.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing blocking.
