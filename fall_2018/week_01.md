## Last Week's Accomplishments

Familarized myself with the codotype repository; not just the react generator but the generator library itself. I've never worked on a code generation project before - so this is pretty exciting!

## This Week's Plan

This week I want to settle on a basic react boilerlplate design to implement. 

## Anything Blocking?

All the engineering designs are in Alex's head - I will have to rely on 1-on-1's to rapidly learn the codebase.
