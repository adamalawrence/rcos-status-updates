## Last Week's Accomplishments

Removed all user/auth code from the codebase. Since this is a desktop application, thereâ€™s no need to have a login/signup page anymore.

## This Week's Plan

Refactor all networking code that was on the node server to the client, turning the full stack app into just a react one.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing blocking.
